// ── (issue #122) the shared sanitisation-placeholder vocabulary ───────────
//
// ONE definition of the upstream literal, read by the inbound SSE filter below,
// by the outbound `request_body` guard, and — through their own imports — by
// the loop's `consume_stream` bolt and the Worker's three guards, so no copy
// can drift.
//
// This module is the home for it (not `harness/loop/turn.rs`, which the plan
// proposed): `mod turn` is PRIVATE to `harness::loop`, so a definition there is
// unreachable from the wire and the Worker without widening `loop.rs` — a file
// outside this task's file set. `openai.rs` is the crate-visible seam the other
// SSE parsers already import from (`LineAssembler`, `parse_arguments`), and
// ADR 0054 puts the wire vocabulary on the wire anyway.

/// (issue #122) The literal placeholder LiteLLM's `_sanitize_empty_text_content`
/// (`factory.py`, `modify_params=True`) substitutes for empty/whitespace string
/// content. It is PRODUCED UPSTREAM — this repo's transcripts only ever *echo*
/// it, and grep across `src/` and `src-tauri/src/` finds zero producers — so
/// both the inbound stream filter and the outbound `request_body` guard key on
