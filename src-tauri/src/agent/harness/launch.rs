    //     `tools:` is ABSENT (the `None` rung — "no allowlist, whatever the
    //     parent offers") has no list to filter, so that leg is unhandled here.
    //   * The filter also runs over a list that came from the explicit
    //     `subagent` param. That is deliberate: a file may only ever make a
    //     child MORE restricted, so dropping a denied name from the explicit
    //     list narrows rather than grants — and when it empties that list the
    //     result is ZERO tools, the honest reading of "you may only use bash"
    //     plus "bash is denied" (= nothing). Zero tools is still NARROWER than
    //     the parent's set, so narrowing-only holds.
    //
    // A list the deny empties yields `Some(vec![])` — ZERO tools — and NOT
    // `None`. This is deliberately NOT `narrow`'s ADR 0067 emptied-means-ABSENT
    // rule, and the distinction matters: ADR 0067 exists to stop a TYPO or a
    // STALE NAME in an allowlist from accidentally zeroing a child, i.e. it
    // guards against UNINTENDED narrowing. Here the emptiness is produced by a
    // DELIBERATE `deny`, so that rationale does not apply — and falling back to
    // ABSENT is strictly worse than what ADR 0067 guards against, because
    // `None` is not "no tools": `subagent_flow.rs`'s three-way rule reads it as
    // "the parent's list minus the guard". So the old `None` fallback made the
    // MOST restrictive possible file (every advertised tool denied) the LEAST
    // restrictive outcome — adding a deny GAVE THE CHILD MORE TOOLS than the
    // same file without the deny, the exact inverse of issue #101's invariant
    // ("a definition can make its own agent stricter … it can never grant past
    // it") and of its acceptance item "drop the tool from the child's
    // `enabled_tools` … so the model is never offered a call it can't make".
    // The empty set is what the downstream actually means by "no tools":
    //   * `subagent_flow.rs`'s `Some(tools)` arm filters `subagent` /
    //     `list_agents` and passes the rest VERBATIM, and its comment says so —
    //     "a non-empty set that empties out yields NO tools — NOT re-expanded";
    //   * `worker/core.rs` applies `enabled_tools` VERBATIM — "a legitimately-
    //     empty child tool set must NOT re-expand into all tools — the recursion
    //     guard";
    //   * the `[]` = ALL expansion lives in the `None` arm and reads
