//! Who owns a child process's Windows console, and its stdin.
//!
//! The shipped Windows build is a GUI-subsystem process
//! (`src/main.rs:2` — `#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem =
//! "windows")]`), so it has no console for a console-subsystem child
//! (`cmd.exe`, `fd`, `rg`, an `npx.cmd` shim) to inherit; Windows then
//! allocates a console per child, and creating a console creates a window —
//! one blank `cmd.exe` window per shell command. `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` is the
//! documented lever that suppresses the window; mechanism, citations and the
//! triage are in `docs/research/windows-child-console-window.md`, the choice
//! of a constructor as the owner is ADR 0060.
//!
//! Two invariants this module exists to hold:
//!
//! * **One owner for the creation flags.** `creation_flags` REPLACES rather
//!   than ORs (rust-lang/rust#96794 — there is no getter to read the previous
//!   value back), so a second caller anywhere in the crate silently un-hides
//!   the child and re-opens a window per command. That is why the flag lives in
//!   the constructor rather than at each call site, and it is why any future
//!   `CREATE_SUSPENDED` or `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` belongs **in this module**
//!   and nowhere else: a call site has no `Command` to set a flag on except one
//!   that came from here, so composing the flags has exactly one legal place.
//!   [`command`] / [`command_std`] are therefore the only two constructors, and
//!   [`hide`] / [`hide_tokio`] stay private.
//! * **`closed_stdin` is opt-in, never part of the constructor.** Nulling stdin
//!   is right for a **Tool child** (the Agent asked for `sh -c …`; a command
//!   that reads stdin must reach EOF rather than block on an inherited pipe
//!   until the 300 s bash timeout) and wrong for every **Runtime child** — the
//!   Worker's JSONL stdin, an MCP server's JSON-RPC stdin and `sudo_exec`'s
//!   password stdin are pipes we actively write. The Tool/Runtime split is the
//!   API, not an oversight.
//!
//! `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` is documented as ignored for a child that is not a
//! console application, so the two sites that spawn **our own exe** — the
//! `--worker` self-exec (`src/agent/worker/client.rs`) and the updater relaunch
//! (`src/commands/update.rs`) — could never pop a window in the shipped build,
//! where the exe is GUI-subsystem. They still route through here, for two
//! reasons: in a *debug* build the attribute is off and the exe is
//! console-subsystem, so the flag is live there; and a site added later
//! inherits the correct default rather than having to know this paragraph.
//! A reader who spots the apparent no-op should stop here, not "simplify" the
//! call away.
//!
//! What this module deliberately does NOT own: the environment (that is
//! [`crate::agent::hostenv`]), stdout/stderr (each site chooses those), and any
//! `STARTUPINFO`/`SW_HIDE` or `DETACHED_PROCESS` route (the former is
//! nightly-only on stable Rust; the latter is documented to make
//! `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` *ignored*, and leaves the child free to `AllocConsole`).
//!
//! Nothing here is provable by running it — `cargo test` is itself a
//! console-subsystem process, so a child inherits the test harness's console
//! whether or not the flag is set, and neither std nor tokio can read a
//! creation flag back off a `Command`. The census test in this module (Task 3)
//! is what enforces the policy: it scans `src/` for a `Command::new(` outside
//! these two constructors and fails the build on one.

    // LINT — it proves no production site bypasses the module that owns the
    // policy, in the spirit of `hostenv::configured_env` ("the only honest
    // introspection available" for the same class of reason).
    //
    // Scanned: `src/**/*.rs` ONLY. `tests/*.rs` is deliberately NOT scanned —
    // those integration fixtures build raw `Command`s ON PURPOSE (they launch
    // the built binary, and a fixture that wanted the policy opts in
    // explicitly), so scanning them would demand a change to code whose job is
    // to be the outside view of the app.
    //
    // And it is a LINT, not a parser: it matches TEXT, so a string literal or a
    // `concat!` fragment containing `Command::new(` would also trip invariant A.

    /// **Why the region and not the file.** [`is_comment`] is what makes this
    /// rule usable: `crashlog.rs` contains the literal string
    /// `dirs::data_dir()` THREE times right now and not one of them is code —
    /// twice in the module `//!` doc (`:13` and `:21`, which sit INSIDE the
    /// scanned region, so only the comment filter saves them) and once in a
    /// `///` doc comment inside `mod tests` (`:251`, which the region boundary
    /// excludes before the filter is even consulted). A naive "the file
    /// contains the string" rule would therefore be a PERMANENT false
    /// positive — the kind that gets the test deleted rather than the code
    /// fixed. The region stops at the first non-comment `#[cfg(test)]`
    /// (`crashlog.rs:133`), which is also why the test-side mentions can never
    /// leak in.
