//!
//! The file lives in the platform DATA dir beside `mcp-auth.json`
//! ([`auth_file_path`] resolves it exactly like `mcp::oauth::auth_file_path`
//! — interface ruling R3; NEVER the config dir, which is a DIFFERENT
//! directory on Linux: `~/.config/archimedes` vs
//! `~/.local/share/archimedes`). The spec's `~/.archimedes/provider-auth.json`
//! is shorthand for "the same dir as `mcp-auth.json`" (ADR 0018) — a literal
//! `~/.archimedes` would be invisible to the app's own path conventions.
//!
//! Hermeticity is path INJECTION, never relocation: every read/write takes a
//! `&Path` (the `mcp::manager` `with_auth_file` precedent), so a test passes a
//! scratch path and production passes [`auth_file_path`] — the two are the
//! same path by construction, never by convention.
//!
//! Known Windows limitation: this file is created WITHOUT a mode argument on
//! Windows; it inherits the user profile ACL exactly like the sibling
//! `mcp-auth.json` (no `#[cfg(windows)]` ACL code exists in this repo). Unix
//! gets `0600` AT CREATION (never chmod-after-write).
