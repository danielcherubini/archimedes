//! Google Application Default Credentials (ADC) — the `gcloud_adc` flow (issue #128).
//!
//! Reads the ADC file (NEVER writes one), validates the `authorized_user`
//! shape, exchanges the refresh token natively over HTTP, and caches the minted
//! access token IN MEMORY ONLY for 50 minutes.
//!
//! Two invariants this module exists to hold, both pinned by
//! `src-tauri/tests/provider_gcloud_adc.rs`:
//!
//! 1. **Zero `gcloud` CLI subprocess.** The exchange is a `reqwest` POST; no
//!    child process is ever spawned here (the zero-subprocess census scans this
//!    file's production region for `Command::new(` / `process::Command` /
//!    `tokio::process` text and FAILS — not prints — on a hit).
//! 2. **The minted access token is never written to disk.** This module performs
//!    NO persistence at all: it reads one file, posts one request, and stores
//!    the result in the process-memory cache below. It takes no `store` import
//!    and must never gain one — the provider-auth store is the ONE place the
//!    suite persists credentials, and an ADC access token must not join it
//!    (the never-`store` census + the store-stays-absent runtime assertion).
//!
//! Discovery is READ-ONLY: nothing here creates `~/.config/gcloud`, and no test
//! reads the developer's real ADC file — every fixture injects its own path.
