///
/// # The comparison is CANONICAL on both sides
///
/// `resolved` arrives canonical from the EXECUTOR callers (both go through
/// [`FsBackend::resolve`], which canonicalizes). A deny-list entry is NOT
/// necessarily canonical: production fills `ctx.protected` from
/// `boundary::protected_dirs()` — which canonicalizes — but nothing in the
/// type system enforces that, and any other caller (a test, a future session
/// bootstrap, a plugin seam) may hand raw paths. Comparing a canonical
/// `resolved` against a raw entry with a plain `starts_with` therefore silently
/// NO-OPS the deny-list, and "refused in EVERY policy" is exactly the property
/// that must not depend on the caller's hygiene. This is a real, observed
/// bypass, not a hypothetical: on macOS CI the temp dir sits under `/var`,
/// which is a symlink to `/private/var`, so `resolved` = `/private/var/…` never
/// prefixed the raw `/var/…` entry and the protected write SUCCEEDED (the same
/// tests reddened macOS and Windows CI, where a canonical `\\?\C:\…` verbatim
/// path never matched a raw `C:\…`).
///
/// So each entry goes through the SAME lenient canonicalization as the
/// compared path (issue #92). A strict `canonicalize()` on an entry that does
/// not exist yet simply FAILS, and a failed compare is a silent NON-MATCH —
/// which is the very hole `boundary::protected_dirs` now keeps the entry to
/// close, so the two halves are one change and neither alone is a fix.
/// Already-canonical entries canonicalize to themselves, so the production
/// path (and Linux CI) is unchanged. The REFUSAL still names the ORIGINAL
/// entry: the message must show the caller the directory it actually
/// registered, not a rewritten one — hence `find` over the caller's slice,
/// never a map onto the canonicalized form.
///
/// The recorded residue (#92, D3): an entry whose whole path cannot be
/// resolved at all comes back RAW, and a raw entry cannot prefix-match a
/// canonical resolved path — so on macOS (`/var` → `/private/var`) or Windows
/// (`\\?\C:\…`) a write into such a dir is NOT refused. That is strictly
/// better than the pre-#92 behaviour, where the dir was dropped from the list
/// outright, and nothing fixes it by peeling harder because there is nothing
/// to peel to. Pinned by `protected_dirs_keeps_an_unresolvable_entry_raw`.
///
/// # The COMPARED path is canonicalized the same way
///
/// The mirror case is just as much a mismatch: the GATE caller
/// (`harness/loop.rs::deny_tool_result`) hands the model's RAW argument here,
/// while its `protected` entries arrive CANONICAL from
/// [`crate::agent::boundary::protected_dirs`]. Canonicalizing the entries
/// cannot reach that at all — the mismatch is now on the other side, and a raw
/// `/var/…` never prefix-matches the canonical `/private/var/…` entry (macOS),
/// and a raw `C:\…` never matches the verbatim `\\?\C:\…` one (Windows).
///
/// What that mismatch costs is worth stating exactly, because the obvious
/// story is wrong. The DENY-LIST is no longer one of the things the policy
/// moves — and since the permissions spec's round-3 correction it is not one
/// of the things that moves AT ALL on its own: the executors consult
/// [`write_rule_refusal`] first, and this sentence is reached only for a rule
/// `Deny` (row 1) whose target falls under the list. What the widening moves is
/// the BOUNDARY check: `write_backend` builds its `roots` from
/// `ctx.file_policy.writes`, so under `Allow` the roots go unrestricted and
/// `validate` stops refusing.
///
/// The gate's copy exists for the DENY path, where it decides WHICH refusal the
/// model reads (the guard-membership sentence, or "escapes the sandbox"). So a
/// raw protected path reaching that seam slipped the membership MATCH and came
/// back worded as a boundary escape — the model sent hunting for a boundary that
/// is not the problem, which is precisely the drift the shared text exists to
/// prevent. That is the bug this canonicalization closes from the gate side.
///
/// So the compared path goes through
/// [`crate::agent::fs_backend::canonicalize_lenient`] — the peel-to-deepest-
/// existing-ancestor seam [`FsBackend::resolve`] itself uses, NOT a second
/// canonicalizer, because the gate must agree with the executor about where a
/// path lands. A not-yet-existing write target is exactly the shape the gate
/// sees, which is why a plain `canonicalize` was never going to work here.
///
/// Two directions of the remaining slop are worth naming:
/// * The re-appended components (below the deepest existing ancestor) are
///   compared as plain strings, so they cannot hide a symlink hop. At THIS
///   seam that only ever errs toward a FALSE POSITIVE — an over-refusal —
///   because the comparison's only power is to DENY (a deny-list match
///   refuses; nothing here can grant anything). Fail-closed in the safe
///   direction, and the symlink-at-an-existing-component case that `resolve`
///   rejects outright cannot make this seam ALLOW: it can only make a path
///   compare differently, and comparing differently here means missing the
///   entry, which is what the canonicalization just fixed.
/// * A path that cannot be resolved at all comes back unchanged, i.e. the raw
///   spelling is compared — the pre-fix behaviour for that (rare, unresolvable)
///   shape, never worse.
///
/// The EXECUTOR callers hand paths that `FsBackend::resolve` already
/// canonicalized: lenient-canonicalizing them again is IDEMPOTENT (a canonical
/// path canonicalizes to itself, so the peel stops on its first step and the
/// comparison is unchanged). Their behaviour, and Linux CI, are byte-identical.
