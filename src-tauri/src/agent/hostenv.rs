//! What a child process should inherit, minus the AppImage's own paths.
//!
//! The shipped Linux bundle is an AppImage, and its `AppRun` (a compiled
//! `AppRun.c`, plus the `linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk.sh` hook) `putenv`s a stack of
//! search-path variables — `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`, `PYTHONHOME`,
//! `GI_TYPELIB_PATH`, the `GTK_*` family, … — whose components point inside
//! `/tmp/.mount_archim*`. std materialises the child's `envp` from the parent's
//! env, so EVERY child (`sh`, `fd`, `rg`, a stdio MCP server, the Worker
//! self-spawn, `sudo`) inherits that stack: `node` dies on
//! `version 'OPENSSL_3.4.0' not found` and `git`/`rg`/`grep` degrade to
//! unversioned symbol binding. Evidence and citations:
//! `docs/research/appimage-child-process-env-leak.md`.
//!
//! The fix is per-child and surgical: strip only the components that point
//! inside an AppImage mount, and gate the whole thing OFF unless we are
//! genuinely running from one — a `.deb` install, an `.rpm` install and a
//! `cargo run` dev build must behave byte-identically to before.
//!
//! Two invariants this module exists to hold:
//!
//! * **`scrub` is pure.** It takes the inherited environment, `APPDIR` and the
//!   current exe as *arguments* and returns an [`EnvPatch`]; it reads no
//!   process state and touches no `Command`. That is what lets its tests run in
//!   parallel without the process-env lock (`crate::test_support::env_lock`).
//! * **Set-or-remove, never a map.** `env_remove` is not representable as a
//!   map entry, and "the strip emptied this variable" is the interesting case:
//!   the variable may not have existed before the `AppRun` invented it, and
//!   `env(var, "")` is NOT equivalent to removing it.
//!
//! Never `env_clear()` a child on the strength of this patch: std documents
//! that a child with no `PATH` falls back to `confstr(_CS_PATH)` rather than
//! the parent's, and still exits 0 — a dropped `PATH` is a silent regression,
//! which is exactly why this module filters `PATH` instead of removing it.
